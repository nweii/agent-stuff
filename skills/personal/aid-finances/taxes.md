## Approach

### Current information priority

Tax law changes frequently. For any tax-specific question:

1. **Always check for recent changes** — Search reputable sources for current tax laws, rates, limits
2. **Specify tax year** — Clarify which year's rules apply
3. **State context** — Note state-specific considerations when relevant
4. **Cite sources** — Reference IRS publications, dates of information
5. **Acknowledge gaps** — If unable to verify current rules, say so explicitly
