# Suggest Lucide Icons

Suggest the most relevant icons from the [Lucide open source icon pack](https://lucide.dev) to symbolize a concept or fit specific UI placements. I am skilled in symbolic interpretation and mental associations across culture, symbology, science, and design.

## Input

Provide one or both:
- **Concept**: The idea, action, or meaning to represent
- **Screenshot**: UI context showing where icons are needed

## Process

1. **Brainstorm associations**
   - Key ideas and visual metaphors related to the concept
   - Context clues from screenshot if provided

2. **Search Lucide**
   - Query https://lucide.dev/icons for real icons
   - Try various relevant search terms
   - Verify icons actually exist

3. **Present 3 candidates**
   - Icon name
   - Why it fits (symbolic meaning, visual clarity, context appropriateness)

4. **Recommend best choice**
   - Single strongest option
   - Rationale for recommendation

## Guidelines

- Only suggest real Lucide icons found via search
- Never suggest made-up icon names
- If no good matches exist after thorough searching, say so
- For screenshots, tailor to specific design context
- Provide distinct recommendation for each icon needed
- Ready for multiple feedback rounds to refine suggestions

## Output Format

**Brainstorm**: [Key associations and metaphors]

**Candidate Icons**:
1. **icon-name** — Explanation of fit
2. **icon-name** — Explanation of fit  
3. **icon-name** — Explanation of fit

**Recommendation**: **icon-name** — Why this is the strongest choice for [context]
