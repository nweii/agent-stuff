# Agent Stuff

Personal prompts, skills, and commands I use with Claude and Cursor. Some are highly specific to my own setup (like my Obsidian vault). Sharing publicly in case any of it's useful or interesting to others.

## Agent skills format

This repo uses the [Claude Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) [format](https://agentskills.io). Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and instructions. The `description` field tells AI agents when to load and apply the skill.

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Metadata + instructions
├── reference.md          # Optional: detailed docs
└── supporting-file.md    # Optional: additional context
```

## Using these

Copy whatever looks useful into your own `.claude/skills/` or `.cursor/skills/` directory. Or use the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill) CLI to quickly add items from this repo:

```bash
bunx skills add nweii/agent-stuff

# or
npx skills add nweii/agent-stuff
```

Install a specific skill:

```bash
bunx skills add nweii/agent-stuff --skill [skill-name]
```

Updating skills:

```bash
bunx skills update
```

To update a specific skill, run `skills add` again with the same skill.
