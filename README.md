# Agent Stuff

Personal prompts, skills, and commands I use with Claude and Cursor. Some are highly specific to my own setup (like my Obsidian vault). Sharing publicly in case any of it's useful or interesting to others.

## What's here

- **Skills** — Instructions that Claude/Cursor automatically apply based on context
- **Commands** — User-invoked slash commands for specific workflows
- **Reference** — Documentation on Agent Skills, Cursor rules, and how components work together
- **Templates** — Starting points for creating new skills, commands, and rules

## Agent skills format

This repo uses the [Claude Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) [format](https://agentskills.io). Skills are folders containing a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter and instructions. The `description` field tells AI agents when to load and apply the skill.

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Metadata + instructions
├── reference.md          # Optional: detailed docs
└── supporting-file.md    # Optional: additional context
```

Commands are standalone markdown files with prompts that get invoked via `/command-name`.

## Using these

Copy whatever looks useful into your own `.claude/skills/` or `.cursor/skills/` directory. Adapt as needed.

You can also use the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/add-skill) CLI to quickly add items from this repo:

```bash
bunx skills add nweii/agent-stuff
```

Or use `npx` if you prefer.

Note: Some skills reference personal vault notes not included in this repo.
